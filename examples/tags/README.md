# Example: Tags

This configuration file shows how you can make a personalized feed of posts with one or more tags.

## Instructions

1. Create the feed and replace `ATURI` with the full record AT-URI. Should look like `at://YOUR_DID/app.bsky.feed.generator/some_rkey`
2. Update the `DID` placeholders with your DID. There are several references, so be sure to update all of them.
