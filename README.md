# supercell

> A supercell is a thunderstorm characterized by the presence of a mesocyclone, a deep, persistently rotating updraft.

Supercell is a lightweight and configurable atproto feed generator.

# Configuration

The following environment variables are used:

* `HTTP_PORT` - The port to listen on for HTTP requests.
* `EXTERNAL_BASE` - The hostname of the feed generator.
* `DATABASE_URL` - The URL of the database to use.
* `JETSTREAM_HOSTNAME` - The hostname of the JetStream server to consume events from.
* `ZSTD_DICTIONARY` - The path to the ZSTD dictionary to use.
* `CONSUMER_TASK_ENABLE` - Whether or not to enable the consumer tasks.
* `FEEDS` - The path to the feeds configuration file.
* `RUST_LOG` - Logging configuration. Defaults to `supercell=debug,info`

The feed configuration file is a YAML file that contains the feeds to serve and how to match events to the feed. It supports a variable number of matchers with different rules. Matching is done in order and uses json path plus the matcher implementation.

```yaml
feeds:
- uri: "at://did:plc:4acsffvbo4niovge362ptijz/app.bsky.feed.generator/3la5azib4xe2c"
  name: "Smoke Signal Support"
  description: "The Smoke Signal Support feed."
  allow: ["did:plc:cbkjy5n7bk3ax2wplmtjofq2"]
  deny: "at://did:plc:4acsffvbo4niovge362ptijz/app.bsky.feed.post/3la5bsyzj3j23"
  matchers:
  - path: "$.did"
    value: "did:plc:tgudj2fjm77pzkuawquqhsxm"
    type: equal
  - path: "$.commit.record.facets[*].features[?(@['$type'] == 'app.bsky.richtext.facet#tag')].tag"
    values: ["smoke", "signal"]
    type: sequence
  - path: "$.commit.record.facets[*].features[?(@['$type'] == 'app.bsky.richtext.facet#link')].uri"
    value: "https://smokesignal.events/"
    type: prefix
  - path: "$.commit.record.embed.external.uri"
    value: "https://smokesignal.events/"
    type: prefix
```

The `equal` matcher performs an exact string match matched paths.

The `prefix` matcher performs a prefix string match on matched paths. Given the value "foo bar baz", the following prefixes would match: "foo", "foo ", etc.

The `sequence` matcher performs a sequence string match on matched paths. This is used to match a list of values in order making flexible ordered matching without needing regex or complex reverse lookups.

Consider the example string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". The following sequences would match:

* "the" "quick"
* "brown"
* "brow" "fox" "lazy" "dog"
* "the" "dog"

JSONPath is a query language for JSON. When used with matchers, JSONPath will use all nodes as inputs and each matcher will match against any of the values.

For example, the following json would match the `equal` matcher with both `$.text` and `$.tags.*`:

```json
{
    "text": "foo",
    "tags": ["foo", "bar"],
}
```

The site [https://jsonpath.com/](https://jsonpath.com/) is a great resource for testing JSONPath queries.

See the `config.example.yml` file for additional examples.

# TODO

* use i64, it's fine
* possible scoring function for queries
* add likes
* support deletes
* document how to register a feed
